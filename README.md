# Bio-snippets
A place for various tiny code-snippets, stuff for discussion, etc.

- [circles](./circles.ipynb) -- an exercise with `tidyr` reshape and `ggplot`-circles with `geom_arc`
- [dotplot-gen](https://github.com/alex-bochkarev/dotplot-gen) -- a dotplots-related tool (see the link for more info, it is a separate repo)
- **Bash tools**
  - [every-file](./run_for_every_file.sh) -- a boilerplate shellscript to run a command for every file in the current directory (or in some directory; or some type of files in some directory, etc.);
