#+TITLE: How to join two files.

Assume you have two files:

#+begin_src bash
  $ cat ./file1.txt

  f1 f2 f3
  a 1 -1
  b 2 -1
  c 3 -1
  d 4 -1

  $ cat ./file2.txt

  f1 f2 f3
  b 7 -2
  d 8 -2
  e 10 -2
#+end_src

Let's say we want to join these two files by =f1= field. This can be done with a standard GNU/Linux =join= as follows:
#+begin_src bash
 $ join --header -a1 -a2 -eNA file1.txt -o 0 1.2 1.3 2.2 2.3 file2.txt
f1 f2 f3 f2 f3
a 1 -1 NA NA
b 2 -1 7 -2
c 3 -1 NA NA
d 4 -1 8 -2
e NA NA 10 -2 
#+end_src

with the options being:
- =--header= treats the first line as a header (no matching done),
- =a1= and =a2= prints lines that are present in one file only,
- =-eNA= fills in empty values with =NA=,
- =file1.txt=, =file2.txt= are, obviously, file names.
- =-o 0 1.2 1.3 2.2 2.3= sets the output format:
  + matched field first (=0=)
  + =1.2= and =1.3= -- the second and third fields of the first file
  + =2.2= and =2.3= -- the second and third fields of the second file
